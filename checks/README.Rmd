Not every package is going to work every time, for every user, across every installation, with all data.  The examples in this directory attempt to mitigate this for `replyr` by showing `replyr` in use with multiple data sources:

 * `data.frame`
 * `tbl`
 * `SQLite`
 * `MySQL` (not currently in out test suite)
 * `PostgreSQL`
 * `Spark` 2.0.0

Because a lot of the above systems depend on configuration and systems out of the R ecosystem we expect a lot of variation and a lot to go wrong.  So the examples here also have a touch of "here it is working at least once" to them.  Or put another way: these examples are the guarantee that new users are never the first to test common cases.
